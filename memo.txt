Try a do not touch me game first. Monitor where the use click on the screen and change the picture with no part of cat's body in that area.
Have different pictures for similar reigion and display them randomly. If not change, stay still or choose another one?

Procrastination is huge problem in most people's life including students, professionals and everyone else.
I am going to create an app to deal with this problem by constantly reminding people of important events.

Ideas:


Features:
1. Silent mode? User can set a period of time to keep Noisy Cat silent. Such as during sleep time or rest time or work time?
Could have a work time timer. Ask the people did they really work that long? Method to trim the time if not. 
2. Have feature to add friend? Rank the work time and compare with friends. Rank the events done using Noisy Cat.
3. One enssential part should be counting. Counting the days using Noisy Cat, events done and so on. 
4. Game type? Raise your cat by working.
5. Maybe not cat? Not working for everyone. Maybe people can choose? Noisy Animal?
6. The most fundamental feature should be the notifications. 
This app should be able to work behind the stage. Sending out a lot of notifications.
7. The user should be able to create events, drag events. See all past events. Set a finish time on each event. 
8. Working with some learning apps schedule. 
9. Notification giving out whenever user start using their phones.
10. Events and notifications should not go easily. Ask the user to make sure or keep the events for at least 2 or 3 times.
11. Pay to download or inner pay? Pay to make the user more motivated. 
12. Start free, working with schools or companies. Find classes the need this app the most, such as sci 90, UNVS 1, HS 1, mental health
psychology. Work with conselors, work with tutoring centers and mental health center and so on. Work with student dorms? 
Orientations and so on.
